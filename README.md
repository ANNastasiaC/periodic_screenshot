# periodic_screenshot

To track how I spend my time on the computer, made in 10 minutes lol.
It takes screenshots periodically so I can review my day later.

## How it works

- The Python script `screenshot_10s.py` takes a screenshot every 5 minutes.  
- I used a shell script to run it and added the shell script to 'login items' in the settings app to run it at login.
